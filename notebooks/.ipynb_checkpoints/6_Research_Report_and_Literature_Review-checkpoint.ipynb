    "#  Step 6: Research Report and Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents the scientific foundation and rationale for our project, highlighting the importance of early detection of lung cancer using **circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation** and **microRNA (miRNA) expression** patterns. It also includes a curated summary of related research, methodology, and motivation for this integrative machine learning-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Research Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Lung cancer remains the **leading cause of cancer-related deaths** worldwide, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis. Traditional diagnostic methods are invasive and often fail to detect tumors in early stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid biopsy—a non-invasive method analyzing cfDNA and miRNA from blood samples—offers a promising solution for early cancer detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Research Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Develop a machine learning-based integrative pipeline using cfDNA methylation and miRNA expression signatures to distinguish **early-stage lung cancer** from normal samples with high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to build a robust, explainable, and reproducible pipeline that can serve as a preliminary diagnostic tool or a research prototype for translational applications in precision oncology.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Biological Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cfDNA Methylation**: Aberrant methylation patterns at CpG sites are among the earliest epigenetic changes in tumorigenesis.\n",
    "- **miRNA Expression**: Oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRNAs regulate cancer-associated genes and serve as sensitive biomarkers.\n",
    "- **Combined Utility**: Integrating both omics layers enhances model robustness and captures complementary disease signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature Review Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Study | Dataset | Focus | ML Model | Outcome |\n",
    "|-------|---------|-------|----------|---------|\n",
    "| Zhang et al. (2019) | TCGA | cfDNA methylation | SVM | 85% accuracy |\n",
    "| Chen et al. (2020) | GEO + TCGA | miRNA biomarkers | Random Forest | AUC: 0.91 |\n",
    "| Qiu et al. (2021) | TCGA | cfDNA + miRNA integration | XGBoost | Improved sensitivity |\n",
    "| Our Study | TCGA (LUAD) | cfDNA + miRNA | Logistic Regression, RF, SVM | AUC > 0.92 |\n",
    "\n",
    " *This project combines cfDNA methylation and miRNA expression in a single ML pipeline—filling a gap in prior studies that mostly used them separately.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Methodological Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessing**: Imputation, normalization, and standard scaling\n",
    "- **Integration**: Merging datasets via common sample IDs\n",
    "- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance\n",
    "- **Deployment**: Streamlit app with live prediction capability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combining multi-omics signals improved overall performance\n",
    "- Random Forest provided highest AUC and biologically interpretable features\n",
    "- Several CpG sites and miRNAs identified align with published lung cancer markers\n",

    "##  Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This research demonstrates the feasibility of applying ML to **multi-omics liquid biopsy data** for early cancer detection. The integrative approach has potential for clinical translation after further validation with independent cohorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook concludes the documentation and lays the foundation for a **research paper submission** and potential **thesis project abroad**.\n",
